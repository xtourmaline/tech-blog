        "content": "Earn League Points (LP) by winning ranked matches to climb the ladder in League of Legends. You can start playing ranked matches when you reach level 30 in LoL. There are two ways to rank up in League of Legends – solo/duo queues and flex queues. The former lets you go solo or with another player in the queue. This makes it harder to communicate as you’ll be paired with strangers. As for flex queue, you can bring your friends along for the ride, even if they’re on different ranks. The game will automatically pick opponents that will balance out these differences.",
